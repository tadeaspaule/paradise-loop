# paradise-loop
I've been following <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deep-Learning-Python-Francois-Chollet/dp/1617294438">this</a> amazing book to learn deep learning in Keras, and, inspired by the character on generative models using RNNs, decided to make one of my own.

## Split into two files
#### Training file
This Jupyter Notebook contains the code to train and save Keras models.

#### Generation file
This Jupyter Notebook contains the code to generate 'Paradise Lost'-like text of arbitrary length and characteristics wiht the models obtained from the previous file.
