# paradise-loop
I've been following <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deep-Learning-Python-Francois-Chollet/dp/1617294438">this</a> amazing book to learn deep learning in Keras, and, inspired by the character on generative models using RNNs, decided to make one of my own.
The 'Loop' part of the name refers to the fact that initially I imagined an endlessly scrolling text field of some poem, generated by an AI, and Paradise Lost was the first poem that came to mind.

## Split into two files
#### Training file
This Jupyter Notebook contains the code to train and save Keras models.

#### Generation file
This Jupyter Notebook contains the code to generate 'Paradise Lost'-like text of arbitrary length and characteristics wiht the models obtained from the previous file.
